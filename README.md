# brew what?

A small tool for getting [brew](https://brew.sh) descriptions and homepage links for a list of packages. 

Problem: I wanted to know what exactly I had installed via brew, and `brew list` wasn't sufficient.

Solution: I created a little API that I could request the description and homepage for a POST'ed list of commands.
